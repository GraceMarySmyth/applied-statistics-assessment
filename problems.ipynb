    "# Initial experiment: Lady tasting Tea\n",
    "\n",
    "In the design of experiments in statistics, the lady tasting tea is a randomized experiment devised by Ronald Fisher and reported in his book The Design of Experiments (1935).[1] The experiment is the original exposition of Fisher's notion of a null hypothesis, which is \"never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation\".[2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The example is loosely based on an event in Fisher's life. The woman in question, phycologist Muriel Bristol, claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Her future husband, William Roach, suggested that Fisher give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order.[4] One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the specific number of cups she identified correct (in fact all eight), but just by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's description is less than 10 pages in length and is notable for its simplicity and completeness regarding terminology, calculations and design of the experiment.[5] The test used was Fisher's exact test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment provides a subject with eight randomly ordered cups of tea – four prepared by pouring milk and then tea, four by pouring tea and then milk. The subject attempts to select the four cups prepared by one method or the other, and may compare cups directly against each other as desired. The method employed in the experiment is fully disclosed to the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is that the subject has no ability to distinguish the teas. In Fisher's approach, there was no alternative hypothesis,[2] unlike in the Neyman–Pearson approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic is a simple count of the number of successful attempts to select the four cups prepared by a given method. The distribution of possible numbers of successes, assuming the null hypothesis is true, can be computed using the number of combinations. Using the combination formula, with $n=8$ total cups and $k=4$ cups chosen, there are:\n",
